Latency: Time taken for request to complete. Help identify performance bottleneck, network issues .etc.

Traffic: Volume of requests processed bys sytem ,help understand usage patterens, scalability needs, spikes or drops in demand

Errors: rate of failed requests, help identify bugs, software issues, external dependencies causing disruptions or impacting system functionality negatively.

Saturation: measures system resource utilisation, such as cpu, memory disk, network. Monitoring this, can help resource exhaustion, performance decrease, and failures due to resource constraints.

# 4 Golden Rules of Monitoring - how to monitor

Monitor everything that matters: monitor all critical components, and metrics that impact performance, availability and security of systems. 

Monitor proactively, not reactively: stop waiting for issues to occur, proactive monitoring aims to detect and address problems before they impact the syste, ensures optimal system performance, and minimise downtime

Monitor from the user's perspective: reflect end user experience, measuring response time, transaction success rates and user interaction, can provide insight for whrre to improve

Alert intelligently and take action: generating alerts is important, make sure that they are relevant, actionable and not overwhelming. Thresholds and fine tuning the alert rules can enable effective and timely resolution of the issues
